### [DevOps Foundations: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-foundations-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery) (Pluralsight)
- Benefits
	- Build and see the see the result fast is better, reduce feedback loop
- Automation > Manual
	- Not only because human are prone to error, but also because there are many variables, many diffs between each time we deploy something. That diff better be automated.
- Just like how manual testing enable a lot of other sub-product benefit, automation CI CD can also enable of a lot more benefits that we didn't thought of on the beginning, like better dev exp, ...
- CI
	- Is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.
	- All developers check in their code at least once a day, so we can make sure that everything still compiles and all of the tests still succeed.
	- In short, it's just:
		- Plz merge code frequently
		- The workflows
			- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2011.02.41@2x.png)
			- Which will test, build, compile, and things, except deploy
- CDelivery
	- Is a software development principle where software can be released to production at any time.
	- In short, it is tools like the capsitrano
- CDelivery vs CDeployment
	- CDelivery
		- Software can be deployed to production any time
	- CDeployment
		- Software is automatically deployed to production all the time
- Full flow

- Deployment types
	- Blue-green
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2011.13.40@2x.png)
	- Canary
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2011.14.09@2x.png)
	- Feature Flag

		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2011.15.03@2x.png)
	- GitOps
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2011.16.11@2x.png)
- Whatever branches you create, make sure that it results in a common branch used by all and everybody commits to it daily.
	- A common pitfall here is that organizations create many branches for all sorts of things like separate features or versions of the software.
		- This can work, but only when they are treated as main branches, meaning that everyone commits to them daily.
		- Otherwise, the benefits of continuous integration go away, as you would have to do a big manual integration anyway. 
### [Testing Automation: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/testing-automation-big-picture/) (Pluralsight)
- Benefits
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2014.35.35@2x.png)
- The cost increase
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2014.37.46@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2014.38.18@2x.png)
- Why cost increase
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2014.39.21@2x.png)
- UnitTest
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.06.34@2x.png)
	- A unit test can be something than spans over a class or a file. As long as it work together as a coherent unit of behavior
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.08.03@2x.png)
	- Suppose we have unit A, B. Unit A has file A1 A2 A3, unit B has file B1 B2 B3. Test one time 3 files A1 A2 A3 can still be a unit test. But test A and B is integration test. And A to C is integration test.
- Integration test
	- When multi unit of behaviors work together
- But still, integration and unit test is subjective on each team.
	- If connect external resource, can not be considerated as unit test anymore
- Subcutaneous test
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.13.11@2x.png)
- Comparasation
	- Scope
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.13.44@2x.png)
	- Dimension

- Functional User Interface Test
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.17.18@2x.png)
- Good amount of test
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-24%20at%2017.31.43@2x.png)
- Exploratory Testing
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-25%20at%2017.46.08@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-25%20at%2010.05.45@2x.png)
- Have callbacks
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2011.44.43@2x.png)
- Docker setup
	- Add credentials
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2011.52.55@2x.png)
	- Add stage

	- Run Jenkins
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2011.56.15@2x.png)
	- Then have a new container

### [Building a Modern CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-modern-ci-cd-pipeline-jenkins) (Pluralsight)
- Jenkins terms
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2009.37.21@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.37.31@2x.png)
	- If a stage fails, the nexts not run
- Steps
	- Setup
		- Get Github Personal token
		- Add Github server
			- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2010.50.50@2x.png)
			- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2010.51.34@2x.png)
		- Add Jenkin Plugin(if not have)
			- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2010.52.42@2x.png)
- Can run the script on Jenkin web too:
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.47.33@2x.png)
- Can execute other languages:
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.49.05@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.49.46@2x.png)
- Instead of run Jenkin script in web, we can put it in our code:
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.50.32@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.52.21@2x.png)
- Have variables like Github:
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.51.33@2x.png)
- Run docker by using Jenkin:
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-28%20at%2017.59.53@2x.png)
- Jenkin and Github actions
	- Jenkin can work on personal server
	- Github Action use yml, Jenkin use its own syntax
	- When using GitHub Actions, you are essentially bound to Github’s source code management platform
- Jenken looks neat
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2011.41.01@2x.png)
- Support parallel
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2012.24.14@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2012.26.17@2x.png)
- Conditional running
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2012.35.53@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2013.07.34@2x.png)
- Input step
	- Also conditional, but like, for the QAs to test and accept if test is allowed to deploy to production
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2012.39.06@2x.png)
		- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2012.55.32@2x.png)
- Declarative vs scripted pipelines
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2013.05.15@2x.png)
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2013.05.23@2x.png)
- Can import Groovy files and run
	- ![](Attachments/CleanShot%202023-08-29%20at%2013.14.00@2x.png)
