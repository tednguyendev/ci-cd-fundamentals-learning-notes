### [DevOps Foundations: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/devops-foundations-continuous-integration-continuous-delivery) (Pluralsight)
- Benefits
	- Build and see the see the result fast is better, reduce feedback loop
- Automation > Manual
	- Not only because human are prone to error, but also because there are many variables, many diffs between each time we deploy something. That diff better be automated.
- Just like how manual testing enable a lot of other sub-product benefit, automation CI CD can also enable of a lot more benefits that we didn't thought of on the beginning, like better dev exp, ...
- CI
	- Is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.
	- All developers check in their code at least once a day, so we can make sure that everything still compiles and all of the tests still succeed.
	- In short, it's just:
		- Plz merge code frequently
		- The workflows
			- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 11.02.41@2x.png]]
			- Which will test, build, compile, and things, except deploy
- CDelivery
	- Is a software development principle where software can be released to production at any time.
	- In short, it is tools like the capsitrano
- CDelivery vs CDeployment
	- CDelivery
		- Software can be deployed to production any time
	- CDeployment
		- Software is automatically deployed to production all the time
- Full flow

- Deployment types
	- Blue-green

	- Canary

	- Feature Flag

	- GitOps
		- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 11.16.11@2x.png]]
- Whatever branches you create, make sure that it results in a common branch used by all and everybody commits to it daily.
	- A common pitfall here is that organizations create many branches for all sorts of things like separate features or versions of the software.
		- This can work, but only when they are treated as main branches, meaning that everyone commits to them daily.
		- Otherwise, the benefits of continuous integration go away, as you would have to do a big manual integration anyway. 
### [Testing Automation: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/testing-automation-big-picture/) (Pluralsight)
- Benefits
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 14.35.35@2x.png]]
- The cost increase
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 14.37.46@2x.png]]
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 14.38.18@2x.png]]
- Why cost increase
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 14.39.21@2x.png]]
- UnitTest
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.06.34@2x.png]]
	- A unit test can be something than spans over a class or a file. As long as it work together as a coherent unit of behavior
		- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.08.03@2x.png]]
	- Suppose we have unit A, B. Unit A has file A1 A2 A3, unit B has file B1 B2 B3. Test one time 3 files A1 A2 A3 can still be a unit test. But test A and B is integration test. And A to C is integration test.
- Integration test
	- When multi unit of behaviors work together
- But still, integration and unit test is subjective on each team.
	- If connect external resource, can not be considerated as unit test anymore
- Subcutaneous test
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.13.11@2x.png]]
- Comparasation
	- Scope
		- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.13.44@2x.png]]
	- Dimension
		- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.18.10@2x.png]]
- Functional User Interface Test
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.17.18@2x.png]]
- Good amount of test
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-24 at 17.31.43@2x.png]]
- Exploratory Testing
	- ![[CleanShot 2023-08-25 at 10.05.45@2x.png]]
